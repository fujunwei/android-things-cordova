Cordova on Android Things allows developers to use standard web
technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform
development. This creates new opportunities for mobile developers as
they now have another platform where they can seamlessly deploy their
applications.

This project will be a repository for sample code that combines Cordova,
plugins and UPM/MRAA for IO programming on Android Things devices. See
also https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/android-things-samples for more
information on writing UPM/MRAA Java programs for Android Things.

The project wiki at https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/android-things-cordova/wiki
contains information and pointers that will help get you started.
